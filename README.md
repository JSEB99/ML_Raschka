# Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn 

- Author: Sebastian Raschka

This repository implements the exercises and codes from the book

## Contents

1. In chapter 2, you will find **perceptron** and **adaline** implementations, using just Python and NumPy. This implementation covers standarization version and multiclass version for perceptron
2. In chapter 3, you will find implementation of different classification models with scikit learn (without going too deep) as:
   1. Perceptron/Adaline
   2. Logistic Regression
